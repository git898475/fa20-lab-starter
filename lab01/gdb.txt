Question：

1.While you're in a gdb session, how do you set the arguments that will be passed to the program when it's run?
2.How do you create a breakpoint?
3.How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
4.If the next line of code is a function call, you’ll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function (i.e. step into the function) instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
5.How do you continue the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
6.How can you print the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
7.How do you configure gdb so it displays the value of a variable after every step?
8.How do you show a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
9.How do you quit out of gdb?

Solution:

1.set arg1 arg2 + run
2.break functionName   or    break rowNumber    
3.continue  or next  or step
4.next  step  
5.continue
6. print variable     print *arr@n
7.display variableName
8.info locals
9.quit
