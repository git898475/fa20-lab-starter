question:
1.The register representing the variable k.
2.The register representing the variable sum.
3.The registers acting as pointers to the source and dest arrays.
4.The assembly code for the loop found in the C code.
5.How the pointers are manipulated in the assembly code.

solution:
1.t0
2.s0
3.source: s1,dest: s2
4.from line44 to line62
5.slli s3 t0 2将k乘4，后加入到source指针上，进行source的遍历
